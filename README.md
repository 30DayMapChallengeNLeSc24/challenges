This year the Netherlands is picking up the challenge to participate in the [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) organized by [Topi Tjukanov](https://github.com/tjukanovt). We see this challenge as a way to show the diversity of projects we are working on and will try to get the 30 maps.. 

As [eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) we decided to solely work with Free and Open Source Software for this challenge. As a workflow we generally processed the data in our own software or through our own workflow, which we then processed in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) and finalized in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.softonic.nl/). 

Below an overview of the various categories of the Challenge for 2024. 

We will try to get as much maps as possible ;-)
