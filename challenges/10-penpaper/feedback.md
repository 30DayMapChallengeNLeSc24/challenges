Discussion Tim & Maurice

1. Windparken should be the core of the map, should be highlighted more. Make the rest less present (lighter colors?)
2. Legend to right below
3. Elephant next to windturbine
4. Train does not look like a NS train (222 meter), maybe change it s little (or refrain using NS colour, or change it to more old fashioned train)
5. Paste the map on a table / wood
6. Houses on RANDstad region
7. Boat near Rotterdam
8. Remove 2 fishes (maybe keep 3?) 
9. Move the electricity ~11 MW to current position legend
10. Remove the sun, since we do not have any solar energy in the map
